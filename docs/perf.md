# Performance

Every speed attempt, kept or not: what was tried, the result (`make bench`, warm cache), and why it
was kept or reverted. Newest last.

Baseline: Python cctrail 0.2.1, `cctrail stats --by workdir --json` on ~10 GB of Codex and ~0.9 GB
of Claude history (M-series Mac, 2026-10-14): 27.2 s wall, 18.0 s user, 528 MB peak RSS.

Rust port (feat/rust-port, same history, `make bench-ref`, 2026-10-14): 4.4 s wall (4.1–4.8),
7.7 s user, 3.1 s system, ~570 MB peak RSS; 0.2.1 in the same run 26.5 s. Only ~2.5 cores busy and
memory above the Python's: the leads for phase 2.
